How does Prolog respond to the following queries?

01. X  =  3*4.
02. X  is  3*4.
03. 4  is  X.
04. X  =  Y.
05. 3  is  1+2.
06. 3  is  +(1,2).
07. 3  is  X+2.
08. X  is  1+2.
09. 1+2  is  1+2.
10. is(X,+(1,2)).
11. 3+2  =  +(3,2).
12. *(7,5)  =  7*5.
13. *(7,+(3,2))  =  7*(3+2).
14. *(7,(3+2))  =  7*(3+2).
15. 7*3+2  =  *(7,+(3,2)).
16. *(7,(3+2))  =  7*(+(3,2)).
